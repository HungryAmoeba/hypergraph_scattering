# some utilities for processing data perhaps?

# this is a todo since I don't exactly know what form
# all of our data is going to come in. However, it seems
# wise to perhaps define a hypergraph class. I'm not 100%
# sure what the model is going to be either. Perhaps it'd be 
# nice to have everything in the form of something that's 
# end to end differentiable and written as a pytorch model
